# Project: Todo List [Live Demo](https://lukastars.github.io/todo-list)

### Overview
This is my take on the Todo List App, I tried to make it more advanced and practical with extra functionalities. 
#### **Features:**
* Data is **saved** in `localStorage`
* You can **add tasks to seprate projects for more organization/categorization**
* You can add **due-date** for your tasks
* You can **change task due-date** after addition
* You can **delete a particular task or a whole project**
* There is a **project tab for tasks that its due-date is today** 

#### **Technologies Used:**
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript

#### **Tools:**
* Visual Studio Code
* Git and GitHub

#### **Outcome:**
* Used **HTML5 semantic elements** for better structure and readability
* Used **CSS Flex** to create the layout
* Used `localStorage` to save the data
* Deepened my knowledge of **DOM manipulation**, **HTML structure**, **CSS styling subtleties** and **JS functionality** in general
* Had lots of fun with adding the animation for deleting a task or a project! ðŸŽ¨
